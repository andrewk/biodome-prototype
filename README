OVERVIEW_______________________________________________________________________

Biodome is a collection of Devices and Sensors, combined in any
way that suits your needs. Devices can be scheduled to be on or off in one
hour blocks over a 24 hour schedule, and can be automatically turned on or off
depending on sensor readings. All sensor data and system events are written to 
an SD card in CSV format. The device schedule is a simple TXT file that also 
lives on the SD card.

Device: 
	Anything that can be ON or OFF. Intended to be switched via a relay
	which in turn is activated by a digital pin from the Arduino. All Devices
	must extend upon the base Device class.
	
Sensor: 
	Sensor is the interface for reading environment variables. All sensors 
	must extend upon the base Sensor class, and implement their own update() 
	method to instruct the sensor to collect new data. Each Sensor can only 
	return a single value, which must be a float.
	

REQUIREMENTS___________________________________________________________________

Biodome has been designed for minimum cost, with a primary goal of "bang for 
buck". As such, features such as ethernet/wifi connectivity have been excluded 
from the initial design to reduce micro controller infrastructure costs.

To build your own Biodome you will need:
	- an Arduino or Arduino-compatible micro controller with an ATmega AT328.
	- SD card hardware capability for the Arduino*
	- Real Time Clock (RTC) capability for the Arduino*
	- Sensors; eg: TMP36 temperature sensor, an LDR as a light sensor, the SHTxx
	  range of temperature/humidity sensorsâ€¦ any sensor that can be read from an
	  Arduino is compatible with Biodome**

Optional:
	- Devices to schedule or activate. Fans, lights, pumps, alarms, anything! If
	  you just want to monitor an environment and log sensor output, Biodome can
	  very easily do that for you, so you won't need any devices.
	- Relays to go with your devices for switching power on/off
	
* I use and recommend the SDCard shield from adafruit, as it includes an SD card 
reader, an RTC chip with battery and is cheap and easy to assemble.

** The FacadeSensor makes utilizing a third party sensor library effortless.
